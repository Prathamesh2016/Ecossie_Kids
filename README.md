## Background

It is a fact that 75% of Australian electricity comes from coal in the past 30 years while renewable energy accounts for just 5% of energy consumption. There is no doubt that this has contributed to the extreme weather and bushfires in Australia. Besides, the wholesale electricity prices of Australia have increased exponentially for the last decade, with Victoria having the highest increase among other states. With global warming and expensive electricity bills, Victorian households are hit with a huge blow these days. Due to the problems mentioned, Eco Pathseekers is motivated to develop an informative website named Ecossies bank for young children aged 9-10 living in Victoria households.
